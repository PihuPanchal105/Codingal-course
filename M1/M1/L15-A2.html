    <p>Click  the button to get a time-based greeting:</p>
    <button onclick="myFunction()">Try it</button>
    <p id="hour"></p>
    <p id="greet"></p>
    <script>
        function myFunction() {
            var greetings;
            var time =| new Date().getHours();
            //new Date() creats a Data object,which lets you extract details like year,month,day,hours,etc. Date() without new just returns the current date and time as a string,not as an object.

            if (time < 10) {
                greeting = "Good morning";
            }
            else if (time < 20) {
                greeting = "Good day";
            }
            else {
                greeting = "Good evening";
            }
            document.getElementById("hour").innerHTML = "Current Hour is  : "+ time;
            document.getElementById("greet").innerHTML = greeting;
        }

<p>In this example, we use the <code>Date()</code> object to get the current hour and display a greeting based on the time of day.</p>
<p>Note: The <code>Date()</code> object is a built-in JavaScript object that provides methods for working with dates and times. It can be used to get the current date and time, as well as to manipulate and format dates.</p>
